# Implementation Plan

Create Kubernetes manifests for the Next.js portfolio application based on the existing hobby cluster patterns and Google Cloud Platform deployment using Flux CD for GitOps.

The implementation will follow the established Kustomize-based pattern from the hobby cluster, providing a complete containerized deployment of the Next.js portfolio application with PostgreSQL database, supporting multi-environment deployments (dev/staging/prod) with proper security, monitoring, and GitOps integration.

## [Overview]

Create a comprehensive Kubernetes deployment setup for the Next.js portfolio application following the hobby cluster's proven patterns.

The portfolio application is a full-stack Next.js application with tRPC API, Drizzle ORM, NextAuth authentication, and a PostgreSQL database. It includes an admin interface for managing blog posts and component demos. The application needs to be containerized and deployed to Google Kubernetes Engine with proper environment separation, security hardening, and GitOps workflow integration.

This implementation will create Docker containers, Kubernetes manifests using Kustomize overlays, database deployment configurations, and Flux CD integration for automated deployments. The setup will support three environments (dev/staging/prod) with appropriate resource scaling and configuration management.

## [Types]

Define Kubernetes resource types and application configuration structures.

**Kubernetes Resources:**

- Deployment: Main application deployment with Next.js container
- Service: ClusterIP service exposing the application on port 3000
- ConfigMap: Environment-specific configuration (DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_URL, etc.)
- Secret: Sensitive data (database credentials, auth secrets)
- PersistentVolumeClaim: Database storage
- NetworkPolicy: Network segmentation and security
- Ingress: External traffic routing with TLS termination

**Database Resources:**

- StatefulSet: PostgreSQL database deployment
- Service: Database service for internal communication
- PersistentVolumeClaim: Database persistent storage
- Secret: Database credentials and connection strings

**Environment Configuration Types:**

- Development: Single replica, minimal resources, debug logging
- Staging: 1 replicas, moderate resources, structured logging
- Production: 1+ replicas, full resources, performance optimizations, high availability

- Database connection handling in `src/server/db.ts`
  - Add connection retry logic for Kubernetes deployments
  - Implement graceful shutdown handling
  - Add connection pooling optimization for containerized environment

## [Classes]

No new classes required, but configuration management enhancements.

**Configuration Management:**

- Environment-specific database configurations
- Container runtime optimizations
- Health monitoring integration
- Graceful shutdown handling

## [Dependencies]

Container runtime and Kubernetes integration dependencies.

**Runtime Dependencies:**

- Node.js 18 Alpine base image for smaller container size

## [Testing]

Comprehensive testing strategy for Kubernetes deployment.

**Container Testing:**

- Docker image build and security scanning
- Container startup and health check validation
- Resource usage and performance testing

**Kubernetes Testing:**

- Manifest validation with `kubectl --dry-run`
- Kustomize overlay testing for each environment
- Network policy validation and connectivity testing

# What LLM-Based Coding Agents Actually Excel At

Everyone knows AI coding agents can generate code and convert between languages. That's table stakes at this point.

But after two decades of writing software and the last few years watching these tools evolve, I've noticed something: most developers are only scratching the surface of what these things can actually do well.

So let's dig in. What are LLM-based coding agents _really_ good at? And more importantly, which models excel at which tasks?

---

## 🎯 The Core Strengths (Beyond the Obvious)

Yes, code generation is the headline feature. But here's what I've found actually moves the needle in day-to-day engineering work:

## 📋 The Complete Strength Matrix

Here's a detailed breakdown of what LLM coding agents excel at, organized by category:

### 1. Pattern Recognition & Generation

| Task                    | Description                           | Why LLMs Excel                              | Best Models                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Boilerplate Code**    | Generating repetitive structural code | Trained on millions of similar patterns     | All major models             |
| **CRUD Operations**     | REST endpoints, database operations   | Extremely well-represented in training data | GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet        |
| **API Integration**     | Connecting to third-party services    | Extensive documentation in training corpus  | Claude Opus, Gemini Pro      |
| **Configuration Files** | Docker, K8s, CI/CD configs            | Pattern-heavy, well-documented              | GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet        |
| **Scaffolding**         | Project structure, file templates     | Consistent conventions across ecosystems    | Cursor (multi-file), Copilot |

**The "Old Guy" Take:** These tasks used to take me 20-30 minutes of copy-pasting from Stack Overflow. Now it's 30 seconds. This is where the 10x productivity actually shows up.

### 2. Code Transformation & Migration

| Task                     | Description                                     | Why LLMs Excel                                | Best Models                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Language Conversion**  | Python → Go, JS → TypeScript                    | Statistical pattern matching across languages | Claude Opus, GPT-5            |
| **Framework Migration**  | React Class → Hooks, Vue 2 → Vue 3              | Extensive migration guides in training data   | Claude Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro |
| **Legacy Modernization** | Old patterns → current best practices           | Understands both old and new conventions      | Claude Opus (long context)    |
| **Syntax Upgrades**      | ES5 → ES6+, Python 2 → 3                        | Deterministic transformation rules            | GPT-4o, DeepSeek R1           |
| **Style Conversion**     | Callback → async/await, imperative → functional | Clear transformation patterns                 | All major models              |

**Real Example:** I recently fed a 5,000-line Perl script from 2005 into Claude Opus and asked it to rewrite it in Go. It took about 3 minutes. Was it perfect? No. Did it get me 85% of the way there? Absolutely.

## ⚠️ Where LLMs Still Struggle

Let's be honest about the limitations:

| Task                          | Why It's Hard                           | Workaround                                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Novel algorithms**          | Limited to patterns in training data    | Use for scaffolding, implement logic yourself |
| **Real-time systems**         | Can't reason about timing/feel          | Be extremely specific about constraints       |
| **Game development**          | No sense of "fun" or game feel          | Use for utilities, not core mechanics         |
| **Audio/DSP**                 | Signal processing is poorly represented | Stick to high-level abstractions              |
| **Complex state machines**    | Struggles with continuous state         | Break into discrete components                |
| **Performance-critical code** | Optimizes for readability, not speed    | Profile and optimize manually                 |

---

## 🧭 The Workflow That Works

After experimenting with dozens of configurations, here's what I've landed on:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[New Feature] --> B{Task Type?}
    B -->|Boilerplate/CRUD| C[GPT-4o / Copilot]
    B -->|Complex Refactor| D[Claude Opus]
    B -->|Large Codebase| E[Gemini 2.5 Pro]
    B -->|Documentation| F[Claude Sonnet]
    B -->|Quick Script| G[Gemini Flash]

    C --> H[Review Output]
    D --> H
    E --> H
    F --> H
    G --> H

    H --> I{Acceptable?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Ship It]
    I -->|No| K[Iterate with Feedback]
    K --> B

    style D fill:#dcfce7,stroke:#166534
    style F fill:#dbeafe,stroke:#1e40af
```

**The key insight:** Match the model to the task. Using Claude Opus for a quick bash script is overkill. Using Gemini Flash for a complex refactor will frustrate you.

---

## 💡 Maximizing Value: Tips from the Trenches

1. **Context is king.** Dump your entire file (or relevant files) into the context. These models are better with more context, not less.

2. **Be specific about constraints.** Don't say "make it fast." Say "optimize for O(n) time complexity."

3. **Use the right model for the job.** Documentation? Claude. Quick generation? GPT-4o. Massive codebase? Gemini.

4. **Iterate, don't regenerate.** If the output is 80% right, edit and refine. Don't start over.

5. **Trust but verify.** These are brilliant interns, not senior architects. Review everything.

---

## 🔮 What's Next?

The trajectory is clear: longer context windows, better reasoning, more autonomous operation.

By 2026, I expect:

- **True repo-wide understanding** without chunking
- **Continuous context** across sessions
- **Execution capabilities** (running and testing code autonomously)
- **Specialized models** for specific frameworks and languages

But for now? We're in a golden age of augmented development. The engineers who learn to leverage these tools effectively will have a significant edge.

The tool doesn't make the craftsman. But a craftsman who ignores better tools is just being stubborn.

Pick your models wisely. Match them to your tasks. And ship faster than you ever thought possible.
